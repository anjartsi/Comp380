				<h2>2-0 Kinematics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Kinematics</b> is the study of motion without considering its causes</li>
					<ul>
						<li> <i>How</i> does an object move? </li>
						<li> Not <i>why</i> an object is moving? </li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>2-1 Position, Displacement, and Distance</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Position: The <b>position</b> of an object describes where the object is relative to a reference frame
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Reference frame</b> means another object that we can use for comparison. </li>
						<li>Some reference frames can be stationary, while other reference frames can be moving. </li>

						<div class="canvasCont color1">
							<h4>Control the <b>position</b> of the block by moving the sliders below:</h4>
							<div class="engineHolder">
								<canvas id="positionCanvas" style=""></canvas>
								<br>
								<div class="controller" id="positionControls"></div>
								<br>
								<button id="positionCanvasBtn" class="hide">Play</button>
							</div>
						</div>

						<li>In the example above, the reference frame we are using is the x-y plane, with the bottom-right corner being the (0,0) point</li>
						<li>Since we need two numbers to represent where the object is, this is a <b>2-dimensional</b> reference frame</li>
					</ul>
					<li> 
						Displacement: When an object moves from one position to another, 
						its change in position is called <b>displacement</b>.
						<ul>
							<li>&Delta;x = x<sub>f</sub> &minus; x<sub>0</sub></li>
							<li>Displacement = final position &minus; initial position</li>
							<li>Greek letter delta (&Delta;) means "change in" whatever quantity follows it.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
					Distance: Distance is defined to be the <i>magnitude</i> (or size) of the displacement between two points
						<ul>
							<li>Note that the distance between two points does not depend on the direction</li>
							<li>Unlike displacement, the distance between two points will never be negative.</li>
							<div class="canvasCont color1">
								<h4>Move the slider to change the position of the ball</h4>
								<h5>Note the difference between displacement and distance.</h5>

						Distance Traveled: The distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.

			<h2>2-2 Vectors, Scalars, and Coordinate Systems</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Vectors: A vector is any quantity that has both a magnitude (size) <b>and</b> a direction
					<br>
					Some examples of vectors are: 
					<ul>
						<li>Position</li>
						<li>Displacement</li>	
						<li>Velocity (described below)</li>
					</ul>
					Vectors can be positive (&plus;) or negative (&minus;). 
					<br>
					Vectors that point in opposite directions have opposite signs<br>
				</li>
				<!-- End vectors -->
				<li>
					Scalars: A scalar is any quantity that has a magnitude (size), but no direction.
					<br>
					Some examples of scalars are: 
					<ul>
						<li>Distance</li>
						<li>Time</li>
						<li>Mass</li>
						<li>Speed</li>
					</ul>
					Scalars are always positive numbers
				</li>
				<!-- End Scalars -->
				<li>
					Coordinate Systems: In order to describe the direction of a vector, we must first dsignate a coordinate system . 
				</li>
				<li>
					One-dimensional: For one-dimensional motion, our coordinate system consists of a one-dimensional coordinate line
					<ul>
						<li>When describing horizontal motion, we usually describe motion to the right as positive and motion to the left as negative </li>
						<li>When describing vertical motion, we usually describe the up direction as positive and the down direction as negative</li>
						<img src="images/x_axis.PNG">
						<img src="images/y_axis.PNG">
						<li>However, it can sometimes be more convenient to switch the positive and negative directions</li>

						<li>For example, if an object is moving towards the left, it makes more sense to call <i>that</i> the &plus;x direction, this is perfectly acceptable.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<!-- End one-dimensional -->
				<li>
					Two-dimensional: 
					<ul>
						<li>For two-dimensional motion, our coordinate consists of the x-y plane </li>
						<img src="images/xy_plane.PNG">
						<li>Again, we are free to switch the positive (&plus;) and negative (&minus;) directions (for both x and y). </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<!-- End two-dimensional -->
			</ul>

			<h2>2-3 Time, Velocity, and Speed</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Time: Time is one of the most fundamental physical quantities. These quantities are defined by how they are measured. 
					<ul>
						<li>Every measurement of time involves measuring a change in some quantity: a heartbeat, the position of the Sun in the sky, the position of Earth around the Sun, etc.</li>
						<li>Thus we can say that time <i>is</i> change, or the interval over which change occurs</li>
						<li>The SI unit for time is the second, abbreviated <i>s</i></li>
						<li>
						The time it takes for something to occur is called its <b>elapsed time</b>
						<br>
						Elapsed time is measured as: 
						&Delta;t = t<sub>f</sub> &minus; t<sub>0</sub>
						(Notice the similarity between this formula and the one for displacement?)
						<br> 
						For simplicity's sake, we will always say that t<sub>0</sub> = 0, thus &Delta;t = t<sub>f</sub>	
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<!-- End Time -->
				<li>
					Velocity: The velocity of an object is described as the <i>rate of change</i> of its position. 
					<ul>
						<li>This means that velocity is a measurement of <i>how fast</i> the position of an object is changing.</li>
						<li>In other words, velocity describes how fast an object is moving.</li>
						<li>The average velocity of an object over a certain period of time is calculated as its total displacement divided by the total elapsed time. </li>
						<ul>
							<li>
							<span style="text-decoration: overline;">v</span> = <sup>&Delta;x</sup> &frasl; <sub>&Delta; t</sub>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>If the velocity of an object is zero, that means that the object is <b>not moving</b> (this is often called being at rest).</li>
						<li>The instantaneous velocity of an object is the velocity of the object at a given moment in time.</li>
						<li>Velocity is a vector, therefore it <b>always has a magnitude and a direction</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li>Thus velocity can be positive or negative</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="canvasCont color1">
							<h4>Press play to see how objects with different velocities move differently</h4>

								<br>
								<button id="velocityCanvasBtn" class="ctrlButton">Play</button>
							</div>
						</div>
					</ul>

					
					<li>Notice that the velocity becomes negative when an object is moving to the left, but its speed is always positive</li>
				</li>
				<li>
					Speed: The speed of an object is the <b>magnitude</b> of its velocity. 
					<ul>
						<li>In everyday language, most people use the terms "speed" and "velocity" interchangeably. But in physics, they do not have the same meaning.</li>
						<li>While velocity is a vector, <b>speed is a scalar</b>.</li>
						<li>The average speed of an object over a given period of time is its total <i>distance travelled</i> divided by the elapsed time. (Note that this is different than the average velocity)</li>
						<li>The instantaneous speed of an object at any given moment is the magnitude of its instantaneous velocity at that moment.</li>

				<h2>2-4 Acceleration</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Acceleration: The acceleration of an object is the <i>rate of change</i> of its velocity
						<ul>
							<li>Acceleration is a measurement of <i>how fast</i> the velocity of an object is changinng</li>									
							<li>
								a = <sup>&Delta;v</sup> &frasl; <sub>&Delta; t</sub>

							<li>This also means that acceleration can be positive or negative</li>
								<ul>

				<h2>2-5 Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Different equations are used for finding an object's properties depening on whether its velocity is constant or not.</li>
					<li>Assume acceleration is constant (<b><span style="text-decoration: overline;">a</span></b> = <b>a</b> = constant).</li>
					<ul>
						<li>These equations do not require acceleration in their calculations:</li>
						<ul>
							<li><span style="text-decoration: overline;">v</span> = <sup>&Delta;x</sup> &frasl; <sub>&Delta; t</sub> = <sup>(x-x<sub>0</sub>)</sup> &frasl; <sub>t</sub> = <sup>(v+v<sub>0</sub>)</sup> &frasl; <sub>2</sub></li>
							<li>x = x<sub>0</sub> + <span style="text-decoration: overline;">v</span>t</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Solving for final velocity requires the use of a constant acceleration:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>a = <sup>&Delta;v</sup> &frasl; <sub>&Delta; t</sub> = <sup>(v - v<sub>0</sub>)</sup> &frasl; <sub>t</sub></li>
							<li>v = v<sub>0</sub> + at</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Solving for final position also requires a constant acceleration:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>x = x<sub>0</sub> + v<sub>0</sub>t + <sup>1</sup> &frasl; <sub>2</sub> * at<sup>2</sup></li>
						</ul>
						<li>Final velocity can be solved without the use of a time variable:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>v<sup>2</sup> = v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2a(x - x<sub>0</sub>)</li>

				<h2>2-6 Problem-Solving Basics for One-Dimensional Kinematics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>In order to understand what is being asked for in a problem and figure out how to solve it, the following steps can be used to simplify the process:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Step 1 - Analyze the problem to see which physics concepts are used.</li>
						<li>Step 2 - Identify given information, such as values.</li>
						<li>Step 3 - Idenfity the unknown information that is being asked for.</li>
						<li>Step 4 - Find an equation (or equations) that may lead you to the desired answer (the unknown information).</li>
						<li>Step 5 - Input the given information into the equation(s) and calculate the solution (with units).</li>
						<li>Step 6 - Analyze the answer to make sure it is reasonable.</li>

				<h2>2-7 Falling Objects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>If air resistance and friction are ignored, then all objects in a certain location on the earth fall to the ground at the same constant acceleration, no matter their mass.</li>
					<li>Air resistance is what causes lighter objects to fall slower than heavy objects. If an object falls without air resistance or friction, then it is in free-fall</li>
					<li>Gravity acts on all objects on Earth, causing them to fall towards the ground at a constant acceleration.</li>
					<li>Assuming upward direction is positive and gravity is g:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>a = -g = -9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
					</ul>
					<li>Objects that only move vertically (such as those in free-fall) only have a vertical velocity. Ignoring air resistance and friction, these objects only move in one dimension with constant acceleration g.</li>
					<li>Equations for objects in free-fall (a = -g):</li>
					<ul>
						<li>v = v<sub>0</sub> - gt</li>
						<li>y = y<sub>0</sub> + v<sub>0</sub>t - <sup>1</sup> &frasl; <sub>2</sub> * gt<sup>2</sup></li>
						<li>v<sup>2</sup> = v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - 2g(y - y<sub>0</sub>)</li>
